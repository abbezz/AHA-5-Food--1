# Getting Started

# Project Title - ACHA Foods!

The purpose of our business is to list details of close-by restaurants/takeaways,  using the customers current location and google maps.
The customer is able to search for any restaurant/take-away name and the application will pick up their current location and list nearby restaurants.  
The application includes information about the restaurant/take away and includes a map picking up current location and provide a route. 
It also has an about us, contact us and social media page. 


## How it Works
 User Story AS A customer, I WANT to search for nearby restaurants/takeaways and access a map, SO THAT I can pick which restaurant to go to based on my current location.

 GIVEN I am a customer, WHEN I search for a specific restaurant name, THEN a list of restaurant/takeaway names, address, opening times, customer ratings and a phone number   appear.
 
 WHEN I am not sure which restaurant to search for, I want to click pre-filtered buttons which give me a list of places to choose from.

 IF I want to go to the location, then I will have access to a map which will give me the fastest route to get there.

## Lessons Learned

# What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
I have never been so nervous before. I lost my self and my confidence in my presentation abut the project but I learned my mistakes and I will progress and be better speaker in the future so thats is my big issues to speak in front of people. I need to be more priperd and build up my communication skills and to trust my self.

Working with a team was a completely new experience for me. I was more comfortable working by myself so working in a group was a challenge and new experiences you got. Everyone has different ideas and imagine collecting all the ideas in one, you can then create incredible and good projects with your team. it was fun but at the same time it was tough. I hope I improve and make new progress in my career in the future.
