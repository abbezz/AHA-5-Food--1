Project Title - ACHA Foods!

The purpose of our business is to list details of close-by restaurants/takeaways,  using the customers current location and google maps.
The customer is able to search for any restaurant/take-away name and the application will pick up their current location and list nearby restaurants.  
The application includes information about the restaurant/take away and includes a map picking up current location and provide a route. 
It also has an about us, contact us and social media page. 


User Story
AS A customer, I WANT to search for nearby restaurants/takeaways and access a map, SO THAT I can pick which restaurant to go to based on my current location.

GIVEN I am a customer, WHEN I search for a specific restaurant name, THEN a list of restaurant/takeaway names, address, opening times, customer ratings and a phone number appear.

WHEN I am not sure which restaurant to search for, I want to click pre-filtered buttons which give me a list of places to choose from.

IF I want to go to the location, then I will have access to a map which will give me the fastest route to get there.
